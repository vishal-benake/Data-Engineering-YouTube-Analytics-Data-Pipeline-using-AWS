## üéØ Project Goals

- **Data Ingestion**  
  Implement a pipeline to collect data from various regional datasets.

- **ETL System**  
  Clean, transform, and prepare raw data for analytics using scalable tools.

- **Data Lake**  
  Use a centralized cloud storage system to host multi-source video data efficiently.

- **Scalability**  
  Ensure the pipeline is flexible enough to handle growing data volume.

- **Cloud Infrastructure**  
  Utilize AWS to process and manage data at scale.

- **Reporting & Visualization**  
  Build an interactive dashboard to explore insights such as top categories, most-liked videos, and regional trends.
